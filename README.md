# Sort It

**This program sorts every file and folder inside of a directory with one command!**

# How are your folders sorted?

#### Your files are sorted into 10 different folders:

- **_FOLDERS**: Folder Type files.
- **Apps**: Application Type files (Installers, executables, etc.).
- **Audio**: Audio files.
- **Video**: Video files.
- **Images**: Image files.
- **PDF**: PDF files.
- **Audio**: Audio files.
- **Text & Code**: Text and Code files.
- **Work**: MS office type files.
- **Audio**: Zipped folder (zip, rar, tar).
- **Other**: Any file that couldn't be identified as any of the above categories.

# Installation

1. Clone this repository somewhere that you will **not be sorting** (I recommend putting it somewhere in your root directory).
2. Add the path to the 'sort-it.exe' and 'unsort-it.exe' to your environment variables.
   - The path to 'sort-it.exe' is '[WHERE-YOU-PUT-IT]/files/target/release/'
   - The path to 'unsort-it.exe' is '[WHERE-YOU-PUT-IT]/unsort/target/release/'
   - Do not include the actual .exe in that path, only the up to the release.
   - This is what mine looks like in my Environment Variables > System Variables > Path:

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory you'd like to sort (or just right click in the directory, and select 'Open In Terminal', which is better in my opinion), and type **'sort-it'** or **'unsort-it'** to sort/unsort your directories!
